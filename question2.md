1) Request server and get elements with params (lastId, count)
2) Draw only viewed elements in container and one/two empty elements before and after this drawed elements 
3) If user scroll elements, draw new elements in container and remove elements that the user does not see
4) After elements end, get new elements like 1 point

Shortly:
We draw only the elements that the user sees

or use react-virtualized
